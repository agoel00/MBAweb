Installation for MBA:
-------------------------

- Set current directory as your current folder in Matlab or put it in your Matlab path.
- Run "run_me_first.m" to add folders to the working path. This needs to be done at the starting of each session.
- Download sample MUSE (https://github.com/facebookresearch/MUSE) en-es data in Matlab format from https://www.dropbox.com/s/353zwahfkz2hvt9/muse_data_en_es.mat?dl=1.
- Copy muse_data_en_es.mat file to "tests" folder.
- Run test files are provided in "tests" folder.
